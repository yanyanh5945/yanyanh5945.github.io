&lt;!-- We have developed a deep learning enhanced joint inversion framework, which takes advantages of a deep neural network to achieve information extraction, fusion, and exchange. Experiments on the joint inversion of DC resistivity data and seismic travel time demonstrate the higher accuracy of recovered physical property values and better structural similarity compared to traditional independent inversions and cross gradient joint inversion. The method proposed in our work can deal with out-of-sample geological structures, different sensing configurations, and nonconforming discretization. Parallel experiments of adding a cross gradient constraint while training the network also validate the capability of our method to extract the structural information from independently recovered models. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proposed a robust progressive learning (RPL) method for the time-domain FWI. Although PL shows improvement on FWI, it requires repeatedly retraining the DNN with a small training dataset. There is no guarantee for the performance to be improved in each loop. The new RPL workflow utilizes an unsupervised learning method to reduce computational costs at the initialization stage. During the DNN training stage, we propose a self-regularized training scheme and use an augmented training dataset to improve the stability of the DNN model. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by ISP and GPR inversion. The experiment results show that our proposed method successfully reconstructed models with the extrapolated low-frequency data and improved the imaging quality of FWI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving inverse problems accurately and efficiently has always been an important issue in subsurface sensing. Pure data-driven machine learning methods have achieved great success in the past few years, but these methods still face questions about reliability. At the same time, extremely massive data without any physical guidance may lead to missing opportunities for breakthroughs. In this work, we propose a physics-driven deep learning framework for providing a fast and accurate surrogate to solve non-linear inverse problems. Particularly, leveraged by the forward physical model and 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the proposed method provides more reliable solutions to the inverse problem with improved performance. Applications for magnetotelluric data inversion demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.&lt;/p&gt;

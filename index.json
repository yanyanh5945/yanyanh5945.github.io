A key issue of joint inversion is to develop effective strategies to link different geophysical data in a unified mathematical framework, where the information obtained from different models can complement each other. In this paper, we propose a deep learning enhanced (DLE) joint inversion framework to simultaneously reconstruct different physical models by fusing different types of geophysical data. Traditionally, structure similarity constraints are pursued by joint inversion algorithms using manually crafted formulations (e.g. cross gradient). In this work, the constraint is constructed by a deep neural network (DNN) during the learning process. The framework is designed to combine the DNN and the traditional independent inversion workflow together and improve the joint inversion result iteratively. The network can be easily extended to incorporate multi-physics without structural changes. Numerical experiments on the joint inversion of 2D DC resistivity data and seismic travel time show that the DLE framework achieves more accurate recovered property values and structural features than independent inversions and conventional cross gradient based joint inversion. In addition, this learning-based framework demonstrates excellent generalization abilities when tested on datasets using divergent geological structures. It can also handle different sensing configurations and nonconforming discretization.","tags":[],"title":"A deep learning enhanced framework for multi-physics joint inversion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuchen Jin","Yuan Zi","Wenyi Hu","Yanyan Hu","Xuqing Wu","Jiefu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662940800,"objectID":"983b829052469e53578e11097e410d99","permalink":"https://yanyanh5945.github.io/publication/2022_learning_method_for_gpr_fwi/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_learning_method_for_gpr_fwi/","section":"publication","summary":"Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a significant role in producing high-resolution subsurface imaging in seismic prospecting and ground penetrating radar (GPR). However, FWI faces various challenges in practice. For example, the lack of low-frequency information due to acquisition limitations will make the FWI prone to falling to the local minimum. In this project, a deep learning-based approach is proposed to extrapolate the low-frequency data. Specifically, we propose a robust progressive learning (RPL) algorithm that combines physics-guided FWI and data-driven deep learning technology. The proposed method is robust against the choice of the initial model. Experimental results show that our method can achieve high efficiency and accuracy by using a limited amount of training data. The subsurface structures are successfully reconstructed with our extrapolated low-frequency data.","tags":[],"title":"A maxwell's equations based deep learning method for time domain electromagnetic simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanyan Hu","Yuchen Jin","Xuqing Wu","Jiefu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627257600,"objectID":"410127c09b9f3ce06f60ef420e821bd6","permalink":"https://yanyanh5945.github.io/publication/2021_rnn_fdtd/","publishdate":"2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_rnn_fdtd/","section":"publication","summary":"In this communication, a trainable theory-guided recurrent neural network (RNN) equivalent to the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method is exploited to formulate electromagnetic propagation, solve Maxwell’s equations, and the inverse problem on differentiable programming platform Pytorch. For forward modeling, the computation efficiency is substantially improved compared to conventional FDTD implemented on MATLAB. Gradient computation becomes more precise and faster than the traditional finite difference method benefiting from the accurate and efficient automatic differentiation on the differentiable programming platform. Moreover, by setting the trainable weights of RNN as the material-related parameters, an inverse problem can be solved by training the network.

Compared to the conventional approach, our method encodes initial conditions, boundary conditions as well as Maxwell's equations as the constraints when training the network, turning an electromagnetic simulation problem into an optimization process. High prediction accuracy of the electromagnetic fields, without discretization or interpolation in space or in time, can be achieved with limited number of layers and neurons in each layer of the neural network. We study several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for simulating time-domain electromagnetic fields. First, the accuracy of this method is validated by comparing with the analytical solution of a 1D cavity model filled with homogeneous media. Then, we combine the continuity condition to modify the loss function for handling medium discontinuities. Further, the computational efficiency of finite-difference and DL methods in conductive and nonlinear media is compared. Finally, we prove the effectiveness of this method in high-dimensional and multi-scale simulations.","tags":[],"title":"A maxwell's equations based deep learning method for time domain electromagnetic simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Figure Caption The deep learning enhanced joint inversion framework.\nResearch Summary We have developed a deep learning enhanced joint inversion framework, which takes advantages of a deep neural network to achieve information extraction, fusion, and exchange.

The SDM provides us a new perspective to combine the classical gradient-based inversion and machine-learning-based inversion schemes. It iteratively learns a set of descent directions in the offline training process, where the training model set is generated in advance according to the prior information, and then updates the models with the learned descent directions as well as data residuals in the prediction stage, resulting in great flexibility to incorporate prior information, the capability of skipping local minima, and accelerated convergence. The generalization ability of the SDM to interrogate new models that are not contained in the training model set is also explored. By utilizing real-time information obtained from the logging process, the learned descent directions can be slightly revised with a higher efficiency to get closer to the true model. In addition, we probe the sensitivity of the SDM by adding different levels of random noise to the measurements. Numerical examples demonstrate that SDM-based inversion can achieve a higher resolution, faster convergence, and higher robustness than conventional schemes such as Occam's inversion.","tags":[],"title":"A supervised descent learning technique for solving directional electromagnetic logging-while-drilling inverse problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Figure Caption Single cell architecture of RNN model for simulating wave propagation using FDTD.\nResearch Summary We have developed a deep learning enhanced joint inversion framework, which takes advantages of a deep neural network to achieve information extraction, fusion, and exchange.

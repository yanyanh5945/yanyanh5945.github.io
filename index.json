A key issue of joint inversion is to develop effective strategies to link different geophysical data in a unified mathematical framework, where the information obtained from different models can complement each other. In this paper, we propose a deep learning enhanced (DLE) joint inversion framework to simultaneously reconstruct different physical models by fusing different types of geophysical data. Traditionally, structure similarity constraints are pursued by joint inversion algorithms using manually crafted formulations (e.g. cross gradient). In this work, the constraint is constructed by a deep neural network (DNN) during the learning process. The framework is designed to combine the DNN and the traditional independent inversion workflow together and improve the joint inversion result iteratively. The network can be easily extended to incorporate multi-physics without structural changes. Numerical experiments on the joint inversion of 2D DC resistivity data and seismic travel time show that the DLE framework achieves more accurate recovered property values and structural features than independent inversions and conventional cross gradient based joint inversion. In addition, this learning-based framework demonstrates excellent generalization abilities when tested on datasets using divergent geological structures. It can also handle different sensing configurations and nonconforming discretization.","tags":[],"title":"A deep learning enhanced framework for multi-physics joint inversion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuchen Jin","Yuan Zi","Wenyi Hu","Yanyan Hu","Xuqing Wu","Jiefu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662940800,"objectID":"983b829052469e53578e11097e410d99","permalink":"https://yanyanh5945.github.io/publication/2022_learning_method_for_gpr_fwi/","publishdate":"2022-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_learning_method_for_gpr_fwi/","section":"publication","summary":"Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a significant role in producing high-resolution subsurface imaging in seismic prospecting and ground penetrating radar (GPR). However, FWI faces various challenges in practice. For example, the lack of low-frequency information due to acquisition limitations will make the FWI prone to falling to the local minimum. In this project, a deep learning-based approach is proposed to extrapolate the low-frequency data. Specifically, we propose a robust progressive learning (RPL) algorithm that combines physics-guided FWI and data-driven deep learning technology. The proposed method is robust against the choice of the initial model. Experimental results show that our method can achieve high efficiency and accuracy by using a limited amount of training data.

It iteratively learns a set of descent directions in the offline training process, where the training model set is generated in advance according to the prior information, and then updates the models with the learned descent directions as well as data residuals in the prediction stage, resulting in great flexibility to incorporate prior information, the capability of skipping local minima, and accelerated convergence. The generalization ability of the SDM to interrogate new models that are not contained in the training model set is also explored. By utilizing real-time information obtained from the logging process, the learned descent directions can be slightly revised with a higher efficiency to get closer to the true model. In addition, we probe the sensitivity of the SDM by adding different levels of random noise to the measurements.
